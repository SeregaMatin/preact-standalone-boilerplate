# Usage
Despite the fact that standalone version of `preact` is used here, due to usage of ES6 modules inside,
to run this project in browser we have to use some http server anyway (otherwise CORS policy violation errors gonna block this app's execution).

So to run this project we have to use some http server.
Below is an example of running this project using `serve` npm package:
* Open cmd/PowerShell
* `npm i -g serve`
* `cd <preact-standalone-boilerplate root dir`
* `serve`
* Open your browser & visit http://localhost:3000/

Feel free to use any other http server you like.
